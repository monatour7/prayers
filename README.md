# Hello, This is the summary of the project
    Describing what the files do in this folder

# First of all we got the admin.py file, that made to display the model that was created in models.py in the admin panel of the site

# After running the server you'll get the server url it has the API i made, the changes you wanted is included (making the words first letter lowercase)

# in the models.py file you'll see how I built the model, it has only 2 attributes

# In the other side there's the serializer file, it doesn't matter if it's exists, I built it to continue the project in front-end 

# The views.py file is created to get the data from the database then make some changes before returning it as a json response 

# The urls.py is used to generate urls (the API I made url and the admin panel url)

# just run the server immediately 
    use "python manage.py runserver" command
    You don't need to execute the custom management file
